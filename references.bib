  abstract = {Recent advances in Deep Learning have largely benefited from larger and more diverse training sets. However, collecting large datasets for medical imaging is still a challenge due to privacy concerns and labeling costs. Data augmentation makes it possible to greatly expand the amount and variety of data available for training without actually collecting new samples. Data augmentation techniques range from simple yet surprisingly effective transformations such as cropping, padding, and flipping, to complex generative models. Depending on the nature of the input and the visual task, different data augmentation strategies are likely to perform differently. For this reason, it is conceivable that medical imaging requires specific augmentation strategies that generate plausible data samples and enable effective regularization of deep neural networks. Data augmentation can also be used to augment specific classes that are underrepresented in the training set, e.g., to generate artificial lesions. The goal of this systematic literature review is to investigate which data augmentation strategies are used in the medical domain and how they affect the performance of clinical tasks such as classification, segmentation, and lesion detection. To this end, a comprehensive analysis of more than 300 articles published in recent years (2018–2022) was conducted. The results highlight the effectiveness of data augmentation across organs, modalities, tasks, and dataset sizes, and suggest potential avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate a narrowly trained convolutional neural network (CNN) denoising algorithm when applied to images reconstructed differently than training data set. Methods: A residual CNN was trained using 10 noise inserted examinations. Training images were reconstructed with 275 mm of field of view (FOV), medium smooth kernel (D30), and 3 mm of thickness. Six examinations were reserved for testing; these were reconstructed with 100 to 450 mm of FOV, smooth to sharp kernels, and 1 to 5 mm of thickness. Results: When test and training reconstruction settings were not matched, there was either reduced denoising efficiency or resolution degradation. Denoising efficiency was reduced when FOV was decreased or a smoother kernel was used. Resolution loss occurred when the network was applied to an increased FOV, sharper kernel, or decreased image thickness. Conclusions: The CNN denoising performance was degraded with variations in FOV, kernel, or decreased thickness. Denoising performance was not affected by increased thickness.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Using common datasets, to estimate and compare the diagnostic performance of image-based denoising techniques or iterative reconstruction algorithms for the task of detecting hepatic metastases. METHODS: Datasets from contrast-enhanced CT scans of the liver were provided to participants in an NIH-, AAPM- and Mayo Clinic-sponsored Low Dose CT Grand Challenge. Training data included full-dose and quarter-dose scans of the ACR CT accreditation phantom and 10 patient examinations; both images and projections were provided in the training data. Projection data were supplied in a vendor-neutral standardized format (DICOM-CT-PD). Twenty quarter-dose patient datasets were provided to each participant for testing the performance of their technique. Images were provided to sites intending to perform denoising in the image domain. Fully preprocessed projection data and statistical noise maps were provided to sites intending to perform iterative reconstruction. Upon return of the denoised or iteratively reconstructed quarter-dose images, randomized, blinded evaluation of the cases was performed using a Latin Square study design by 11 senior radiology residents or fellows, who marked the locations of identified hepatic metastases. Markings were scored against reference locations of clinically or pathologically demonstrated metastases to determine a per-lesion normalized score and a per-case normalized score (a faculty abdominal radiologist established the reference location using clinical and pathological information). Scores increased for correct detections; scores decreased for missed or incorrect detections. The winner for the competition was the entry that produced the highest total score (mean of the per-lesion and per-case normalized score). Reader confidence was used to compute a Jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) figure of merit, which was used for breaking ties. RESULTS: 103 participants from 90 sites and 26 countries registered to participate. Training data were shared with 77 sites that completed the data sharing agreements. Subsequently, 41 sites downloaded the 20 test cases, which included only the 25\% dose data (CTDIvol~=~3.0~±~1.8~mGy, SSDE~=~3.5~±~1.3~mGy). 22 sites submitted results for evaluation. One site provided binary images and one site provided images with severe artifacts; cases from these sites were excluded from review and the participants removed from the challenge. The mean (range) per-lesion and per-case normalized scores were -24.2\% (-75.8\%, 3\%) and 47\% (10\%, 70\%), respectively. Compared to reader results for commercially reconstructed quarter-dose images with no noise reduction, 11 of the 20 sites showed a numeric improvement in the mean JAFROC figure of merit. Notably two sites performed comparably to the reader results for full-dose commercial images. The study was not designed for these comparisons, so wide confidence intervals surrounded these figures of merit and the results should be used only to motivate future testing. CONCLUSION: Infrastructure and methodology were developed to rapidly estimate observer performance for liver metastasis detection in low-dose CT examinations of the liver after either image-based denoising or iterative reconstruction. The results demonstrated large differences in detection and classification performance between noise reduction methods, although the majority of methods provided some improvement in performance relative to the commercial quarter-dose images with no noise reduction applied.},

  abstract = {Background: Deep learning (DL) CT denoising models have the potential to improve image quality for lower radiation dose exams.~ These models are generally trained with large quantities of adult patient image data. ~However, CT, and increasingly DL denoising methods, are used in both adult and pediatric populations. Pediatric body habitus and size can differ significantly from adults and vary dramatically from newborns to adolescents. . Ensuring that pediatric subgroups of different body sizes are not disadvantaged by DL methods requires evaluations capable of assessing performance in each subgroup. Purpose: To assess DL CT denoising in pediatric and adult-sized patients we built a framework of computer simulated image quality (IQ) control phantoms and evaluation methodology. Methods:~ The computer simulated IQ phantoms in the framework featured pediatric-sized versions of standard CatPhan 600 and MITA-LCD phantoms with a range of diameters matching the mean effective diameters of pediatric patients ranging from newborns to 18 years old. These phantoms were used in simulating CT images that were then inputs for a DL denoiser to evaluate performance in different sized patients. Adult CT test images were simulated using standard-sized phantoms scanned with adult scan protocols. Pediatric CT test images were simulated with pediatric-sized phantoms and adjusted pediatric protocols. The framework’s evaluation methodology consisted of denoising both adult and pediatric test images then assessing changes in image quality, including noise, image sharpness, CT number accuracy, and low contrast detectability. To demonstrate the use of the framework, a REDCNN denoising model trained on adult patient images was evaluated. To validate that the DL model performance measured with the proposed pediatric IQ phantoms was representative of performance in more realistic patient anatomy, anthropomorphic pediatric XCAT phantoms of the same age range were also used to compare noise reduction performance. Results: Using the proposed pediatric-sized IQ phantom framework, size differences between adult and pediatric-sized phantoms were observed to substantially influence the adult trained DL denoising model’s performance. When applied to adult images, the DL model achieved a 60\% reduction in noise standard deviation without substantial loss in sharpness in mid or high spatial frequencies. However, in smaller phantoms the denoising performance dropped due to field of view (FOV) differences between adult and pediatric protocols that influence image noise texture. In the validation study, noise reduction trends in the pediatric-sized IQ phantoms were found to be consistent with those found in anthropomorphic phantoms. Conclusion: We developed a framework of using pediatric-sized IQ phantoms for pediatric subgroup evaluation of DL denoising models. Using the framework, we found the performance of an adult trained DL denoiser did not generalize well in the smaller diameter phantoms corresponding to younger pediatric patient sizes. This suggests FOV differences between adult and pediatric protocols can contribute to poor generalizability and must be accounted for in model training and evaluation to ensure pediatric populations benefit from DL denoising.},

  abstract = {Medical imaging increased rapidly from 2000 to 2006, but trends in recent years have not been analyzed.To evaluate recent trends in medical imaging.Retrospective cohort study of patterns of medical imaging between 2000 and 2016 among 16 million to 21 million patients enrolled annually in 7 US integrated and mixed-model insurance health care systems and for individuals receiving care in Ontario, Canada.Calendar year and country (United States vs Canada).Use of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and nuclear medicine imaging. Annual and relative imaging rates by imaging modality, country, and age (children [\&lt;18 years], adults [18-64 years], and older adults [≥65 years]).Overall, 135\,774\,532 imaging examinations were included; 5\,439\,874 (4\%) in children, 89\,635\,312 (66\%) in adults, and 40\,699\,346 (30\%) in older adults. Among adults and older adults, imaging rates were significantly higher in 2016 vs 2000 for all imaging modalities other than nuclear medicine. For example, among older adults, CT imaging rates were 428 per 1000 person-years in 2016 vs 204 per 1000 in 2000 in US health care systems and 409 per 1000 vs 161 per 1000 in Ontario; for MRI, 139 per 1000 vs 62 per 1000 in the United States and 89 per 1000 vs 13 per 1000 in Ontario; and for ultrasound, 495 per 1000 vs 324 per 1000 in the United States and 580 per 1000 vs 332 per 1000 in Ontario. Annual growth in imaging rates among US adults and older adults slowed over time for CT (from an 11.6\% annual percentage increase among adults and 9.5\% among older adults in 2000-2006 to 3.7\% among adults in 2013-2016 and 5.2\% among older adults in 2014-2016) and for MRI (from 11.4\% in 2000-2004 in adults and 11.3\% in 2000-2005 in older adults to 1.3\% in 2007-2016 in adults and 2.2\% in 2005-2016 in older adults). Patterns in Ontario were similar. Among children, annual growth for CT stabilized or declined (United States: from 10.1\% in 2000-2005 to 0.8\% in 2013-2016; Ontario: from 3.3\% in 2000-2006 to −5.3\% in 2006-2016), but patterns for MRI were similar to adults. Changes in annual growth in ultrasound were smaller among adults and children in the United States and Ontario compared with CT and MRI. Nuclear medicine imaging declined in adults and children after 2006.From 2000 to 2016 in 7 US integrated and mixed-model health care systems and in Ontario, rates of CT and MRI use continued to increase among adults, but at a slower pace in more recent years. In children, imaging rates continued to increase except for CT, which stabilized or declined in more recent periods. Whether the observed imaging utilization was appropriate or was associated with improved patient outcomes is unknown.},

  abstract = {Purpose Deep learning (DL) is rapidly finding applications in low-dose CT image denoising. While having the potential to improve the image quality (IQ) over the filtered back projection method (FBP) and produce images quickly, performance generalizability of the data-driven DL methods is not fully understood yet. The main purpose of this work is to investigate the performance generalizability of a low-dose CT image denoising neural network in data acquired under different scan conditions, particularly relating to these three parameters: reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and dose (noise) level. A secondary goal is to identify any underlying data property associated with the CT scan settings that might help predict the generalizability of the denoising network. Methods We select the residual encoder–decoder convolutional neural network (REDCNN) as an example of a low-dose CT image denoising technique in this work. To study how the network generalizes on the three imaging parameters, we grouped the CT volumes in the Low-Dose Grand Challenge (LDGC) data into three pairs of training datasets according to their imaging parameters, changing only one parameter in each pair. We trained REDCNN with them to obtain six denoising models. We test each denoising model on datasets of matching and mismatching parameters with respect to its training sets regarding dose, reconstruction kernel, and slice thickness, respectively, to evaluate the denoising performance changes. Denoising performances are evaluated on patient scans, simulated phantom scans, and physical phantom scans using IQ metrics including mean-squared error (MSE), contrast-dependent modulation transfer function (MTF), pixel-level noise power spectrum (pNPS), and low-contrast lesion detectability (LCD). Results REDCNN had larger MSE when the testing data were different from the training data in reconstruction kernel, but no significant MSE difference when varying slice thickness in the testing data. REDCNN trained with quarter-dose data had slightly worse MSE in denoising higher-dose images than that trained with mixed-dose data (17\%–80\%). The MTF tests showed that REDCNN trained with the two reconstruction kernels and slice thicknesses yielded images of similar image resolution. However, REDCNN trained with mixed-dose data preserved the low-contrast resolution better compared to REDCNN trained with quarter-dose data. In the pNPS test, it was found that REDCNN trained with smooth-kernel data could not remove high-frequency noise in the test data of sharp kernel, possibly because the lack of high-frequency noise in the smooth-kernel data limited the ability of the trained model in removing high-frequency noise. Finally, in the LCD test, REDCNN improved the lesion detectability over the original FBP images regardless of whether the training and testing data had matching reconstruction kernels. Conclusions REDCNN is observed to be poorly generalizable between reconstruction kernels, more robust in denoising data of arbitrary dose levels when trained with mixed-dose data, and not highly sensitive to slice thickness. It is known that reconstruction kernel affects the in-plane pNPS shape of a CT image, whereas slice thickness and dose level do not, so it is possible that the generalizability performance of this CT image denoising network highly correlates to the pNPS similarity between the testing and training data.},
